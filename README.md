Attention! I do not provide a patched version of the client that disables certificate verification, and in principle I am against such a principle of working in the system, in order not to patch the client, you need root, in order to have root, you need to lose all guarantees, unlock the bootloader and wait half a century for a response from the manufacturer or find out what your tech giant does not give unlocking, i.e. the brick generator, I just provide a simplification of tasks for people so that they do not take a steam bath with these semi-annual text inputs, and a couple of three tests still made even a light script work correctly, but as you can see, not everything is fine , if you make a guide to such servers, then you are always welcome, this is a relief for you, for people this is one input text and further installation of everything and everything for this case :)
